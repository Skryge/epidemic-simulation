Simulation of an epidemic in Python

Broadly inspired by the video "Simulating an epidemic" from 3Blue1Brown

Current options :
  - Visual representation of interactions between particles
  - Graph of the evolution of the epidemic in real time (counting susceptible, infected, recovered, dead people)
  - Putting infected people in quarantine zone.


This is a Jupyter code that will not work if you try to run it in a .py script, because the "%matplotlib notebook" IPython Magic Command 
is used. In this case, use the "matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation" function.

Documentation is in French.
